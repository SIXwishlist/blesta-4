# Install

To install the Enverido Blesta module, simply download our latest release,
extract the ZIP file, and place the "enverido" folder in the following
path:

`/path/to/blesta/components/modules/`

The "Enverido" module will then appear under the available list of modules
in Blesta.

Note: If you download this module directly from GitHub rather than through
the Enverido Web UI, you may have to rename the folder that GitHub packages
the repository into. The folder must be named "enverido" otherwise Blesta
will not correctly detect the module.

# Support

As an Enverido customer, you can drop us an email at: help@enverido.com 
if you need any help using this module. Make sure to take a look at our
documentation while you're waiting!
